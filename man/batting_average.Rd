\title{Calculate Batting Average}
\usage{
batting_average(hits, at_bats)
}
\arguments{
\item{hits}{Numeric vector, the number of successful hits for each player.}

\item{at_bats}{Numeric vector, the number of times at bat for each player.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector, the batting averages rounded to three decimal places for each player.
}
\description{
This function calculates the batting average, which is the ratio of hits to at-bats,
for each player provided in the vectors of hits and at-bats. It ensures that all
at-bats entries are greater than zero to avoid division by zero errors, and that
both inputs are non-negative.
}
\examples{
batting_average(c(50, 100), c(150, 300))
batting_average(c(0, 0), c(1, 0))  # Error: 'at_bats' cannot be zero or negative.
}
