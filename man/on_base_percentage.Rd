\title{Calculate On-Base Percentage}
\usage{
on_base_percentage(hits, walks, hit_by_pitches, at_bats, sac_flys)
}
\arguments{
\item{hits}{Numeric vector, the number of hits.}

\item{walks}{Numeric vector, the number of walks.}

\item{hit_by_pitches}{Numeric vector, the number of times hit by pitch.}

\item{at_bats}{Numeric vector, the number of at bats.}

\item{sac_flys}{Numeric vector, the number of sacrifice flies.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector, the on-base percentage rounded to three decimal places. If the denominator
        in the calculation is zero, the function returns NA to avoid division by zero errors.
}
\description{
This function calculates the on-base percentage (OBP), which measures how frequently a batter
reaches base per plate appearance. The formula used is (H + BB + HBP) / (AB + BB + HBP + SF),
where H is hits, BB is walks, HBP is hit by pitches, AB is at bats, and SF is sacrifice flies.
